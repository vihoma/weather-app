## Clavix Integration

This project uses Clavix for prompt improvement and PRD generation. The following slash commands are available:

> **Command Format:** Commands shown with colon (`:`) format. Some tools use hyphen (`-`): Claude Code uses `/clavix:improve`, Cursor uses `/clavix-improve`. Your tool autocompletes the correct format.

### Prompt Optimization

#### /clavix:improve [prompt]
Optimize prompts with smart depth auto-selection. Clavix analyzes your prompt quality and automatically selects the appropriate depth (standard or comprehensive). Use for all prompt optimization needs.

### PRD & Planning

#### /clavix:prd
Launch the PRD generation workflow. Clavix will guide you through strategic questions and generate both a comprehensive PRD and a quick-reference version optimized for AI consumption.

#### /clavix:plan
Generate an optimized implementation task breakdown from your PRD. Creates a phased task plan with dependencies and priorities.

#### /clavix:implement
Execute tasks or prompts with AI assistance. Auto-detects source: tasks.md (from PRD workflow) or prompts/ (from improve workflow). Supports automatic git commits and progress tracking.

Use `--latest` to implement most recent prompt, `--tasks` to force task mode.

### Session Management

#### /clavix:start
Enter conversational mode for iterative prompt development. Discuss your requirements naturally, and later use `/clavix:summarize` to extract an optimized prompt.

#### /clavix:summarize
Analyze the current conversation and extract key requirements into a structured prompt and mini-PRD.

### Refinement

#### /clavix:refine
Refine existing PRD or prompt through continued discussion. Detects available PRDs and saved prompts, then guides you through updating them with tracked changes.

### Agentic Utilities

These utilities provide structured workflows for common tasks. Invoke them using the slash commands below:

- **Verify** (`/clavix:verify`): Check implementation against PRD requirements. Runs automated validation and generates pass/fail reports.
- **Archive** (`/clavix:archive`): Archive completed work. Moves finished PRDs and outputs to archive for future reference.

**When to use which mode:**
- **Improve mode** (`/clavix:improve`): Smart prompt optimization with auto-depth selection
- **PRD mode** (`/clavix:prd`): Strategic planning with architecture and business impact

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. Start with `/clavix:prd` or `/clavix:start` for complex features
2. Refine requirements with `/clavix:refine` as needed
3. Generate tasks with `/clavix:plan`
4. Implement with `/clavix:implement`
5. Verify with `/clavix:verify`
6. Archive when complete with `/clavix:archive`

**Pro tip**: Start complex features with `/clavix:prd` or `/clavix:start` to ensure clear requirements before implementation.
