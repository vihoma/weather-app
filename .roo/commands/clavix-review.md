# Clavix: Review Your Teammate's PR

I'll help you perform a thorough, structured review of a Pull Request. Tell me which PR to review and what aspects to focus on, and I'll generate actionable feedback you can use during your manual review.

---

## What This Does

When you run `/clavix-review`, I:
1. **Ask for PR context** - Which branch or PR to review
2. **Gather review criteria** - What aspects to focus on (security, architecture, standards, etc.)
3. **Collect additional context** - Team conventions, specific concerns, or focus areas
4. **Analyze the diff** - Read changed files and surrounding context
5. **Generate review report** - Structured findings with severity levels
6. **Save the report** - To `.clavix/outputs/reviews/` for reference

**This is about analysis, not fixing. I report issues for you to address.**

---

## CLAVIX MODE: PR Reviewer

**I'm in review mode. Analyzing code changes against your criteria.**

**What I'll do:**
- ✓ Ask clarifying questions about the PR and review focus
- ✓ Retrieve and analyze the git diff
- ✓ Check code against selected criteria
- ✓ Generate structured review report with severity levels
- ✓ Save the report for reference
- ✓ Highlight both issues and good practices

**What I won't do:**
- ✗ Fix issues in the code
- ✗ Approve or merge the PR
- ✗ Skip the criteria gathering phase
- ✗ Make changes to the codebase

**We're reviewing code, not modifying it.**

---

## Self-Correction Protocol

**DETECT**: If you find yourself doing any of these 6 mistake types:

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|------|--------------------|
| 1. Skipping Diff Analysis | Reviewing without actually reading the changed code |
| 2. Ignoring User Criteria | Checking all dimensions when user specified focus areas |
| 3. Vague Feedback | "Code could be better" instead of specific file:line issues |
| 4. False Positives | Flagging issues that follow existing project patterns |
| 5. Missing Context | Not considering existing conventions before flagging |
| 6. Implementation Mode | Starting to fix issues instead of just reporting them |

**STOP**: Immediately halt the incorrect action

**CORRECT**: Output:
"I apologize - I was [describe mistake]. Let me return to the review workflow."

**RESUME**: Return to the review workflow with correct approach.

---

## State Assertion (REQUIRED)

**Before starting review, output:**
```
**CLAVIX MODE: PR Review**
Mode: analysis
Purpose: Criteria-driven code review generating actionable feedback
Implementation: BLOCKED - I will analyze and report, not modify code
```

---

## Instructions

**Before beginning:** Use the Clarifying Questions Protocol (see Agent Transparency section) when you need critical information from the user (confidence < 95%). For PR review, this means confirming which branch/PR, which criteria to apply, and any team conventions.

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

1. **Ask for PR identification:**

   ```
   What PR would you like me to review?

   Options:
   - Provide a branch name (I'll diff against main/master)
   - Describe the feature/change and I'll help locate it
   
   Example: "feature/user-authentication" or "the payment integration branch"
   ```

   **If branch provided**: Confirm target branch for diff (default: main or master)
   
   **If unclear**: Ask clarifying questions to identify the correct branch

2. **Ask for review criteria:**

   ```
   What aspects should I focus on?

   Presets:
   🔒 Security     - Auth, validation, secrets, XSS/CSRF, injection
   🏗️ Architecture - Design patterns, SOLID, separation of concerns
   📏 Standards    - Code style, naming, documentation, testing
   ⚡ Performance  - Efficiency, caching, query optimization
   🔄 All-Around   - Balanced review across all dimensions

   Or describe specific concerns (e.g., "error handling and input validation")
   ```

   **CHECKPOINT:** Criteria selected: [list criteria]

3. **Ask for additional context (optional):**

   ```
   Any team conventions or specific concerns I should know about?

   Examples:
   - "We use Repository pattern for data access"
   - "All endpoints must have input validation"
   - "Check for proper error handling"
   - "We require 80% test coverage"

   (Press Enter to skip)
   ```

   **CHECKPOINT:** Context gathered, ready to analyze

### Phase 2: Diff Retrieval

1. **Get the diff:**
   
   ```bash
   git diff <target-branch>...<source-branch>
   ```
   
   Or if on the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git diff <target-branch>
   ```

2. **If diff retrieval fails:**
   - Check if branch exists: `git branch -a | grep <branch-name>`
   - Suggest alternatives: "I couldn't find that branch. Did you mean [similar-name]?"
   - Offer manual input: "You can paste the diff or list of changed files"

3. **Identify changed files:**
   - Categorize by type: source code, tests, config, documentation
   - Prioritize based on selected criteria (e.g., security → auth files first)
   - Note file count for report

   **CHECKPOINT:** Retrieved diff with [N] changed files

### Phase 3: Criteria-Based Analysis

For each selected criterion, systematically check the diff:

**🔒 Security Analysis:**
- Authentication checks on protected routes
- Authorization/permission verification
- Input validation and sanitization
- No hardcoded secrets, keys, or tokens
- XSS prevention (output encoding)
- CSRF protection on state changes
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- Safe dependency usage

**🏗️ Architecture Analysis:**
- Separation of concerns maintained
- Coupling between components
- Cohesion within modules
- SOLID principles adherence
- Consistent design patterns
- No layer violations (e.g., UI calling DB directly)
- Dependency direction toward abstractions

**📏 Standards Analysis:**
- Descriptive, consistent naming
- Meaningful comments where needed
- Reasonable function/method length
- DRY principle (no duplication)
- Consistent code style
- Clear error messages
- Appropriate logging

**⚡ Performance Analysis:**
- N+1 query detection
- Appropriate caching
- Lazy loading where applicable
- Proper resource cleanup
- Efficient algorithms/data structures

**🧪 Testing Analysis:**
- New code has tests
- Edge cases covered
- Error scenarios tested
- Test quality and readability
- Integration tests for critical paths

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Only analyze criteria the user selected
- Consider existing project patterns before flagging
- Read surrounding code for context
- Be specific: include file name and line number

**CHECKPOINT:** Analysis complete for [criteria list]

### Phase 4: Report Generation

Generate the review report following this exact structure:

```markdown
# PR Review Report

**Branch:** `{source-branch}` → `{target-branch}`

```

---

## Severity Level Guidelines

Use these guidelines for consistent severity assignment:

| Level | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Security vulnerabilities, broken functionality, data loss risk | SQL injection, exposed secrets, auth bypass |
| 🟠 **Major** | Architectural violations, missing tests for critical paths, logic errors | Layer violation, missing error handling, broken edge case |
| 🟡 **Minor** | Code style, naming, minor improvements, non-critical missing tests | Magic numbers, console.log left in, could be more efficient |
| ⚪ **Suggestion** | Nice-to-have improvements, future considerations | "Consider extracting to utility", "Could add more docs" |

**When in doubt:**
- If it could cause production issues → Critical
- If it violates team standards → Major
- If it's preference/style → Minor
- If it's nice but not necessary → Suggestion

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### Large Diffs (50+ files)

```
This is a large PR with {count} files. To provide a thorough review, I'll:
1. Focus on files most relevant to your criteria
2. Prioritize source code over config/docs
3. Provide summary-level notes for less critical files

Would you like me to:
- Focus on specific directories?
- Review all files (may take longer)?
- Prioritize a subset?
```

### No Diff Available

```
I couldn't retrieve the diff. This might be because:
- The branch doesn't exist locally
- You need to fetch the latest changes
- The branch name is different

Try:
- `git fetch origin`
- `git branch -a` to list available branches

Or paste the diff/file list directly.
```

### Conflicting Conventions

If the code follows patterns different from what you'd expect:

```
I noticed this code uses [pattern X], which differs from typical [pattern Y].
Before flagging as an issue, I checked existing code and found this is 
consistent with the project's conventions.

**Not flagged:** [description]
```

---

## Workflow Navigation

**You are here:** PR Review Mode (External Code Analysis)

**This command is for:** Reviewing code you didn't write (teammate PRs)

**Use `/clavix-verify` instead if:** You want to check your own implementation against your PRD

**Common workflows:**
- **PR Review**: `/clavix-review` → [Read report] → [Manual PR review with guidance]
- **After review**: Address findings → Re-run `/clavix-review` to verify fixes

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix-verify` - Check your OWN implementation against your PRD (different use case)
- `/clavix-implement` - Build features (implementation mode)

---

## Agent Transparency (v7.2.2)

### Agent Manual (Universal Protocols)
# Clavix Agent Manual (v5.1)

This is the consolidated agent protocol reference. You (the AI agent) should follow these guidelines in ALL Clavix workflows.

---

## Core Principle: Agentic-First Architecture

Clavix v5 follows an **agentic-first architecture**. This means:

1. **You execute workflows directly** using your native tools (Write, Read, Edit, Bash)
2. **Slash commands are templates** that you read and follow - not CLI commands
3. **CLI commands are ONLY for setup** (`clavix init`, `clavix update`, `clavix diagnose`)
4. **You save outputs to `.clavix/outputs/`** using your Write tool

**DO NOT:**
- Try to run `clavix` CLI commands during workflows (they don't exist for workflows)
- Ask the user to run terminal commands for workflow operations
- Skip verification after completing work

---

## File System Structure

```
.clavix/
├── config.json              # Project configuration
├── outputs/

└── commands/                # Slash command templates (managed by clavix update)
```

---

## REQUIRED: Output Verification Protocol

**After EVERY file operation, verify success:**

| Step | Action | How to Verify |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Write file | Use Write tool |
| 2 | Verify exists | Use Read tool to confirm file was created |
| 3 | Report to user | Show ACTUAL file path (not placeholder) |

**⚠️ Never tell the user a file was saved without verifying it exists.**

---

## Handling Problems Gracefully

When something goes wrong, fix it yourself when possible. When you can't, explain simply and offer options.

### Three Types of Problems

#### 1. Small Hiccups (Fix Yourself)

These are minor issues you can handle automatically. Fix them and move on.

| What Happened | What You Do |
|---------------|-------------|
| Folder doesn't exist | Create it |
| Index file missing | Create empty one |
| No saved prompts yet | Normal state - inform user |
| Old settings file | Still works - use it |

**Your approach:**
1. Fix the issue automatically
2. Maybe mention it briefly: "Setting things up..."
3. Continue with what you were doing

#### 2. Need User Input (Ask Nicely)

These need a decision from the user. Stop, explain simply, and offer clear choices.

| What Happened | What You Ask |
|---------------|--------------|
| Can't find that task | "I can't find task [X]. Let me show you what's available..." |
| Multiple projects found | "I found a few projects. Which one should we work on?" |
| Not sure what you want | "I want to make sure I understand - is this about [A] or [B]?" |
| File already exists | "This file already exists. Replace, rename, or cancel?" |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop what you're doing
2. Explain the situation simply
3. Give 2-3 clear options
4. Wait for their answer

#### 3. Real Problems (Need Their Help)

These are issues you can't fix. Stop completely and explain what they need to do.

| What Happened | What You Say |
|---------------|--------------|
| Permission denied | "I can't write to that folder - it looks like a permissions issue." |
| Config file broken | "Settings file got corrupted. You might need to delete it and start fresh." |
| Git conflict | "There's a git conflict that needs your attention." |
| Disk full | "Disk is full - I can't save anything." |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Explain what went wrong (simply!)
3. Tell them what needs to happen to fix it

### The Golden Rules

1. **Fix it yourself if you can** - Don't bother users with small stuff
2. **Explain simply when you can't** - No error codes, no jargon
3. **Always offer a path forward** - Never leave them stuck
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose what they've done
5. **Stay calm and friendly** - Problems happen, no big deal

---

## Agent Decision Rules

These rules define deterministic agent behavior. Follow exactly.

### Rule 1: Quality-Based Decisions

```
IF quality < 60%:
  → ACTION: Suggest comprehensive analysis
  → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Consider comprehensive depth."

IF quality >= 60% AND quality < 80%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with optimization
  → SHOW: Improvement suggestions

IF quality >= 80%:
  → ACTION: Ready to use
  → SAY: "Quality is good ([X]%). Ready to proceed."
```

### Rule 2: Intent Confidence

```
IF confidence >= 85%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with detected intent

IF confidence 70-84%:
  → ACTION: Proceed, note secondary intent if >25%

IF confidence 50-69%:
  → ACTION: Ask user to confirm

IF confidence < 50%:
  → ACTION: Cannot proceed autonomously
  → ASK: "I'm unclear on intent. Is this: [A] | [B] | [C]?"
```

### Rule 3: File Operations

```
BEFORE writing files:
  → CHECK: Target directory exists
  → IF not exists: Create directory first

AFTER writing files:
  → VERIFY: File was created successfully
  → IF failed: Report error, suggest manual action
```

### Rule 4: Task Completion (Implementation Mode)

```
AFTER implementing task:
  → EDIT tasks.md: Change - [ ] to - [x] for completed task

IF edit succeeds:
  → SHOW: Next task automatically
  → CONTINUE with next task

IF edit fails:
  → SHOW error to user
  → ASK: "Task completion failed. How to proceed?"
```

### Rule 5: Error Recovery

```
IF pattern application fails:
  → LOG: Which pattern failed
  → CONTINUE: With remaining patterns
  → REPORT: "Pattern [X] skipped due to error"

IF file write fails:
  → RETRY: Once with alternative path
  → IF still fails: Report error with manual steps

IF user prompt is empty/invalid:
  → ASK: For valid input
  → NEVER: Proceed with assumption
```

### Rule 6: Execution Verification

```
BEFORE completing response:
  → VERIFY all checkpoints met for current mode
  → IF any checkpoint failed:
    → REPORT which checkpoint failed
    → EXPLAIN why it failed
    → SUGGEST recovery action
```

---

## What You Should NEVER Do

❌ **Don't silently skip tasks** - Always tell user if something was skipped
❌ **Don't make assumptions** - When in doubt, use the AskUserQuestion tool
❌ **Don't give up too easily** - Try to recover first
❌ **Don't overwhelm with options** - Max 3 choices
❌ **Don't use technical language** - Keep it friendly
❌ **Don't blame the user** - Even if they caused the issue
❌ **Don't claim features don't exist** - Check before saying no
❌ **Don't output "saved" without verification** - That's lying to the user

---

## Mode Boundaries

Each Clavix command has a specific mode. Stay within your mode:

| Mode | What You DO | What You DON'T DO |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Improve** | Analyze and optimize prompts | Implement the feature described |
| **PRD** | Guide strategic questions, create PRD | Write implementation code |
| **Plan** | Generate task breakdown | Start implementing tasks |
| **Implement** | Build tasks/prompts | Skip to next task without marking complete |
| **Start** | Gather requirements conversationally | Start implementing |
| **Summarize** | Extract requirements from conversation | Implement the requirements |
| **Verify** | Check implementation, run tests | Fix issues (only report them) |
| **Archive** | Move completed projects | Delete without confirmation |

**If you catch yourself crossing mode boundaries:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Say: "I apologize - I was [mistake]. Let me return to [correct mode]."
3. Resume correct workflow

---

## Communication Style

**Don't say this:**
> "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.clavix/outputs/prompts/'"

**Say this:**
> "Setting up your prompt storage..." (then just create the directory)

**Don't say this:**
> "Error: EACCES: permission denied"

**Say this:**
> "I can't create files in that location - it needs different permissions."

**Don't say this:**
> "SyntaxError: Unexpected token } in JSON"

**Say this:**
> "The settings file got corrupted. I can start fresh if you want."

---

## Clarifying Questions Protocol

# Clarifying Questions Protocol

When the user's request requires critical information to proceed correctly, use this protocol to gather necessary details systematically.

## When to Ask Clarifying Questions

Ask clarifying questions when:
- **Critical ambiguity exists** - The request has multiple valid interpretations that lead to substantially different outcomes
- **Missing essential context** - Information necessary to complete the task successfully is absent
- **Technical specifications needed** - Specific versions, paths, identifiers, or constraints are required
- **User choice required** - Multiple valid approaches exist and the user's preference is needed

**Do NOT ask clarifying questions when:**
- The information is trivial or easily inferred from context
- You can make a reasonable default assumption and mention it
- The question would slow down obviously simple tasks
- You're seeking perfection rather than addressing genuine ambiguity

## Question Format

Use this structured format for maximum clarity and efficiency:

### a. Multiple Choice Questions

When presenting options, use clear labels and make selection easy:

**Question:** [Your question here]

**Options:**
- **a.** First option - brief explanation
- **b.** Second option - brief explanation  
- **c.** Third option - brief explanation

**Please respond with your choice (e.g., 'a' or 'option a').**

### b. Custom Input Questions

When you need specific information not in a predefined list:

**Question:** [Your question here]

**Please provide:** [Clear description of what format/content you need]

**Example:** [Show an example of valid input]

## Confidence Threshold

**Ask clarifying questions when confidence < 95%**

If you're 95%+ confident you understand the user's intent and have the necessary information, proceed without asking. If confidence is below 95%, stop and ask.

## Best Practices

1. **Ask questions sequentially** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions at once unless they're tightly related
2. **Explain why you're asking** - Briefly state what the answer will help you determine
3. **Limit options** - Present 2-4 options maximum for choice questions
4. **Make defaults clear** - If there's a sensible default, state it and ask for confirmation
5. **Batch related questions** - If multiple questions are interdependent, present them together

## Examples

### Good: Clear Multiple Choice
> I need to know where to save the configuration file to proceed correctly.
>
> **Options:**
> - **a.** Project root (recommended for project-specific configs)
> - **b.** Home directory (for user-wide settings)
> - **c.** Custom path (you specify)
>
> **Please respond with your choice (e.g., 'a').**

### Good: Custom Input with Context
> To generate the migration script, I need the database schema version.
>
> **Please provide:** The current schema version number (e.g., "2.1.0" or "v3.4")
>
> If you're unsure, you can check with: `npm run db:version`

### Bad: Unnecessary Question
> ❌ "Do you want me to use good coding practices?"
>
> (This is always implied - just do it)

### Bad: Analysis Paralysis
> ❌ "Should I use const or let for this variable?"
>
> (This is implementation detail - decide yourself based on best practices)

## Recovery Pattern

If you realize you should have asked clarifying questions AFTER starting:

1. **STOP** the current approach
2. **EXPLAIN** what you discovered that requires clarification  
3. **ASK** the necessary questions
4. **RESUME** with the correct approach once answered

**Example:**
> I apologize - I started implementing the auth flow but realized I need to clarify which authentication method you want to use. Are we implementing: (a) JWT tokens, (b) Session-based auth, or (c) OAuth2?

### Example 1: Security-Focused Review

```markdown
# PR Review Report

**Branch:** `feature/user-authentication` → `main`
**Files Changed:** 8 (6 source, 2 tests)
**Review Criteria:** Security
**Date:** 2026-01-12

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

| Dimension | Rating | Key Finding |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Security | 🔴 NEEDS WORK | SQL injection vulnerability in user search |

**Overall Assessment:** Request Changes

---

## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 🔴 Critical (Must Fix)

| ID | File | Line | Issue |
|:--:|:-----|:----:|:------|
| C1 | `src/api/users.ts` | 45 | **SQL Injection**: User search uses string concatenation: `WHERE name LIKE '%${query}%'`. Use parameterized queries. |
| C2 | `src/auth/login.ts` | 23 | **Missing Rate Limiting**: Login endpoint has no rate limiting, vulnerable to brute force attacks. |

### 🟠 Major (Should Fix)

| ID | File | Line | Issue |
|:--:|:-----|:----:|:------|
| M1 | `src/auth/login.ts` | 67 | **Error Disclosure**: Login failure returns "User not found" vs "Invalid password" - allows user enumeration. Use generic "Invalid credentials" message. |

### 🟡 Minor (Optional)

| ID | File | Line | Issue |
|:--:|:-----|:----:|:------|
| m1 | `src/utils/auth.ts` | 12 | **Token Expiry**: JWT expiry set to 7 days. Consider shorter expiry with refresh tokens. |

### ⚪ Suggestions (Nice to Have)

- Consider adding account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Add audit logging for authentication events

---

## ✅ What's Good

- Password hashing uses bcrypt with appropriate cost factor
- HTTPS enforced on all auth endpoints
- Session tokens properly invalidated on logout

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Actions

**Before Merge:**
1. Fix C1: Replace string concatenation with parameterized query
2. Fix C2: Add rate limiting middleware to login endpoint

**Consider for This PR:**
3. Address M1: Use generic error message for login failures

No critical issues found.

### 🟠 Major (Should Fix)

| ID | File | Line | Issue |
|:--:|:-----|:----:|:------|
| M1 | `src/controllers/PaymentController.ts` | 89 | **Layer Violation**: Direct Stripe API call in controller. Should go through PaymentService. |
| M2 | `src/services/OrderService.ts` | 45 | **Circular Dependency**: OrderService imports PaymentService, PaymentService imports OrderService. Extract shared logic to a new service. |

### 🟡 Minor (Optional)

| ID | File | Line | Issue |
|:--:|:-----|:----:|:------|
| m1 | `src/services/PaymentService.ts` | 120 | **Single Responsibility**: `processPayment` method handles payment, receipt generation, and email notification. Consider splitting. |
| m2 | `src/types/payment.ts` | - | **Interface Segregation**: `PaymentProcessor` interface has 12 methods. Consider splitting into smaller interfaces. |

### ⚪ Suggestions (Nice to Have)

## Key Principles Demonstrated

1. **Specificity**: Every issue includes file name and line number
2. **Actionability**: Issues explain what's wrong AND how to fix it
3. **Balance**: Reports highlight positives, not just problems
4. **Severity Accuracy**: Critical = production risk, Minor = style preference
5. **Context Awareness**: Acknowledges when code follows existing patterns
6. **Pragmatism**: Clean PRs get short reports with "ready to merge"


### Self-Correction Protocol
## Self-Correction Protocol

**DETECT**: If you find yourself doing any of these mistake types:

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|------|--------------------|
| 1. Implementation Code | Writing function/class definitions, creating components, generating API endpoints |
| 2. {{MISTAKE_2}} | {{MISTAKE_2_DESC}} |
| 3. {{MISTAKE_3}} | {{MISTAKE_3_DESC}} |
| 4. {{MISTAKE_4}} | {{MISTAKE_4_DESC}} |
| 5. {{MISTAKE_5}} | {{MISTAKE_5_DESC}} |
| 6. Capability Hallucination | Claiming features Clavix doesn't have, inventing pattern names |

**STOP**: Immediately halt the incorrect action

**CORRECT**: Output:
"I apologize - I was [describe mistake]. Let me return to {{MODE_NAME}}."

**RESUME**: Return to the {{MODE_NAME}} workflow with correct approach.

### Recovery Patterns

**If stuck in wrong mode:**
1. Re-read the mode declaration at the top of this template
2. Output the state assertion to reset context
3. Continue from the correct workflow step

**If user asks you to violate mode boundaries:**
1. Acknowledge what they want to do
2. Explain why this mode can't do that
3. Suggest the correct command (e.g., "Use `/clavix-implement` to build that")

**If you made partial progress before catching the mistake:**
1. Stop immediately - don't finish the wrong action
2. Explain what was done incorrectly
3. Ask user if they want to undo/revert those changes
4. Resume from the correct workflow step

### CLI Reference
## CLI Commands Reference (v5.0 - Agentic-First)

Clavix v5 follows an **agentic-first architecture**. Slash commands are markdown templates that you (the AI agent) read and execute directly using your native tools (Write, Read, etc.).

**CLI commands are ONLY for project setup**, not for workflow execution.

---

### Setup Commands (User runs these)

These are commands the **user** runs in their terminal to set up Clavix:

#### `clavix init`
**What it does:** Sets up Clavix in current project
**When user runs it:** First time using Clavix in a project
**Features:**
- Auto-detects AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Configures integrations
- Creates .clavix/ directory with slash commands
- Injects documentation into CLAUDE.md

#### `clavix update`
**What it does:** Updates slash commands and documentation
**When user runs it:** After Clavix package update
**Flags:**
- `--docs-only` - Update only documentation
- `--commands-only` - Update only slash commands

#### `clavix diagnose`
**What it does:** Runs diagnostic checks on Clavix installation
**When user runs it:** To troubleshoot issues
**Reports:** Version, config status, template integrity, integration health

#### `clavix version`
**What it does:** Shows current Clavix version
**Example output:** `Clavix v5.0.0`

---

### How Workflows Execute (Agentic-First)

**In v5, you (the agent) execute workflows directly using your native tools:**

| Workflow | How You Execute It |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Save prompt** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<id>.md` (with frontmatter metadata) |
| **Save PRD** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/<project>/full-prd.md` |
| **Save tasks** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/<project>/tasks.md` |
| **Mark task complete** | Use **Edit tool** to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in tasks.md |
| **Archive project** | Use **Bash tool** to `mv .clavix/outputs/<project> .clavix/outputs/archive/` |
| **List prompts** | Use **Glob/Bash** to list `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` files |
| **Read project** | Use **Read tool** on `.clavix/outputs/<project>/` files |
| **Save review** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/reviews/<id>.md` (with frontmatter metadata) |

---

### Agent Execution Protocol (v5)

**DO:**
1. Use your native tools (Write, Read, Edit, Bash) to perform operations
2. Save outputs to `.clavix/outputs/` directory structure
3. Follow the workflow instructions in each slash command template
4. Report results in friendly language to the user

**DON'T:**
1. Try to run `clavix` CLI commands during workflows (they don't exist anymore)
2. Ask user to run terminal commands for workflow operations
3. Skip verification after completing work
4. Assume CLI commands exist - use your tools directly

# Improved Prompt

[optimized prompt content]
```

---

### Removed Commands (v4 Legacy)

**IMPORTANT:** These commands were removed in v5. Do NOT try to run them:

| Removed Command | How Agents Handle This Now |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `clavix fast/deep` | Use `/clavix-improve` - saves to `.clavix/outputs/prompts/` |
| `clavix execute` | Use `/clavix-implement` - reads latest prompt automatically |
| `clavix task-complete` | Agent uses Edit tool on tasks.md directly |
| `clavix prompts list` | Agent uses Glob/Bash to list `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` |
| `clavix config` | User can run `clavix init` to reconfigure |

**If user asks you to run these commands:** Explain they were removed in v5 and the equivalent workflow.


### Recovery Patterns
## Recovery Patterns for Vibecoders

When something goes wrong, help users gracefully. Always try to fix it yourself first.

---

### Prompt Save Issues

#### Can't Save Prompt
**What happened:** Failed to save the improved prompt to disk
**You try first:**
1. Create the missing directory: `mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts/fast`
2. Retry the save operation

**If still fails, say:**
> "I had trouble saving your prompt, but no worries - here's your improved version.
> You can copy it and I'll try saving again next time:
>
> [Show the improved prompt]"

#### Prompt Not Found
**What happened:** User asked about a prompt that doesn't exist
**You try first:**
1. List files in `.clavix/outputs/prompts/` directory to see what's available
2. Check if there's a similar prompt ID

**Say:**
> "I can't find that prompt. Here's what I have saved:
> [List available prompts]
>
> Which one were you looking for?"

---

### Task Issues

#### Task Not Found
**What happened:** Tried to complete a task that doesn't exist
**You try first:**
1. Read `tasks.md` file to get current tasks
2. Check for typos in task ID

**Say:**
> "I can't find that task. Let me show you the available tasks:
> [List tasks]
>
> Which one did you mean?"

#### Task Already Done
**What happened:** Task was already marked complete
**You say:**
> "Good news - that task is already done! Here's what's left:
> [Show remaining tasks]"

#### Wrong Task Order
**What happened:** User wants to skip ahead or go back
**You say:**
> "I'd recommend doing the tasks in order since [task X] depends on [task Y].
> Want me to:
> 1. Continue with the current task
> 2. Skip ahead anyway (might cause issues)"

---

### Project Issues

#### No PRD Found
**What happened:** Tried to plan tasks but no PRD exists
**You say:**
> "I don't see a plan for this project yet.
> Want me to help you create one? Just describe what you're building
> and I'll put together a proper plan."

#### Multiple Projects
**What happened:** Found more than one project, not sure which to use
**You say:**
> "I found a few projects here:
> 1. **todo-app** - 3 tasks done, 2 remaining
> 2. **auth-feature** - Not started yet
>
> Which one should we work on?"

#### Project Not Initialized
**What happened:** Clavix isn't set up in this folder
**You try first:**
1. Run `clavix init` to set up automatically

**Say:**
> "Let me set up Clavix for this project real quick...
> [After init completes]
> All set! Now, what would you like to do?"

---

### Verification Issues

#### Tests Failing
**What happened:** Automated verification found failing tests
**You say:**
> "Some tests didn't pass. Here's what I found:
>
> ❌ **[Test name]** - [Brief explanation]
>
> Would you like me to:
> 1. Try to fix these issues
> 2. Show you more details about what failed
> 3. Skip verification for now (not recommended)"

#### Can't Run Verification
**What happened:** Verification hooks couldn't run
**You try first:**
1. Check if package.json exists
2. Check for npm/yarn/pnpm lock files

**Say:**
> "I couldn't run the automatic checks. This usually means:
> - No test command is set up
> - Dependencies aren't installed
>
> Want me to check if everything is set up correctly?"

#### Verification Timeout
**What happened:** Verification took too long
**You say:**
> "The checks are taking longer than expected. This might be a big test suite.
> Want me to:
> 1. Keep waiting
> 2. Cancel and mark for manual verification"

---

### File System Issues

#### Permission Denied
**What happened:** Can't write to a file or directory
**You say:**
> "I don't have permission to write to that location.
> This is usually a folder permissions issue.
>
> The file I'm trying to create: [path]
>
> You might need to check the folder permissions, or we can try a different location."

#### Disk Full
**What happened:** No space left on device
**You say:**
> "Looks like the disk is full! I can't save anything right now.
>
> Once you free up some space, we can continue where we left off."

#### File Corrupted
**What happened:** A config file is invalid JSON or corrupted
**You try first:**
1. Check if it's a simple syntax error
2. Try to recover valid data

**If can't recover, say:**
> "One of the config files got corrupted. I can:
> 1. Start fresh (you'll lose saved settings)
> 2. Show you the file so you can try to fix it manually
>
> What would you prefer?"

---

### Git Issues

#### Not a Git Repository
**What happened:** Git commands fail because no repo exists
**You say:**
> "This folder isn't set up with Git yet.
> Want me to initialize it? This will let me track your changes."

#### Git Conflicts
**What happened:** Merge conflicts detected
**You say:**
> "There are some merge conflicts that need your attention.
> I can't automatically resolve these because they need human judgment.
>
> Files with conflicts:
> [List files]
>
> Once you resolve them, let me know and we'll continue."

#### Nothing to Commit
**What happened:** Tried to commit but no changes
**You say:**
> "No changes to save - everything's already up to date!"

---

### Network Issues

#### Timeout
**What happened:** Network request timed out
**You try first:**
1. Retry the request once

**If still fails, say:**
> "Having trouble connecting. This might be a temporary network issue.
> Want me to try again, or should we continue without this?"

---

### General Recovery Protocol

For ANY unexpected error:

1. **Don't panic the user** - Stay calm, be helpful
2. **Explain simply** - No technical jargon
3. **Offer options** - Give 2-3 clear choices
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose user's content
5. **Provide a path forward** - Always suggest next steps

**Template:**
> "Hmm, something unexpected happened. [Brief, friendly explanation]
>
> Don't worry - your work is safe. Here's what we can do:
> 1. [Option A - usually try again]
> 2. [Option B - alternative approach]
> 3. [Option C - skip for now]
>
> What sounds good?"


---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Branch not found
**Cause**: Branch doesn't exist locally or name is incorrect
**Solution**:
- Run `git fetch origin` to get latest branches
- Check spelling with `git branch -a | grep <partial-name>`
- Ask user to confirm exact branch name

### Issue: Diff is empty
**Cause**: Branch is already merged or same as target
**Solution**:
- Confirm the correct source and target branches
- Check if PR is already merged
- Verify branch has commits ahead of target

### Issue: Review seems to miss obvious issues
**Cause**: Criteria didn't include the relevant dimension
**Solution**:
- Re-run with broader criteria (e.g., "all-around")
- Add specific concerns as custom criteria
- Ensure all relevant files are being analyzed

### Issue: Too many false positives
**Cause**: Not accounting for existing project conventions
**Solution**:
- Read more context around flagged code
- Check if pattern is used elsewhere in project
- Ask user about team conventions
- Downgrade severity if pattern is intentional

### Issue: Review taking too long
**Cause**: Large diff or too many criteria
**Solution**:
- Focus on subset of files
- Prioritize by criteria importance
- Break into multiple focused reviews

### Issue: Can't access git repository
**Cause**: Not in a git repository or permission issues
**Solution**:
- Confirm current directory is a git repo
- Check git configuration
- Offer to accept pasted diff instead

### Issue: User wants me to fix the issues
**Cause**: Crossing mode boundaries
**Solution**:
- Remind user this is review mode, not implementation
- Suggest they address issues or ask the PR author
- If they want agent help fixing: "You could open a separate session to implement fixes based on this report"
