# Clavix: Turn Our Chat Into Requirements

Time to capture what we discussed! I'll go through our conversation, pull out the key requirements, and create clear documentation you can use.

---

## What This Does

When you run `/clavix-summarize`, I:
1. **Read our conversation** - Everything we talked about
2. **Extract the requirements** - What you want to build
3. **Organize and improve them** - Make them clear and actionable
4. **Create documentation** - Mini-PRD and optimized prompt files
5. **Flag unclear areas** - Things we might need to discuss more

**I'm capturing what we discussed, not building anything yet.**

---

## CLAVIX MODE: Extraction Only

**I'm in extraction mode. Summarizing our conversation.**

**What I'll do:**
- ✓ Analyze everything we discussed
- ✓ Pull out the key requirements
- ✓ Organize them into a clear structure
- ✓ Create documentation files
- ✓ Tell you what's still unclear

**What I won't do:**
- ✗ Write code for the feature
- ✗ Start implementing anything
- ✗ Make up requirements we didn't discuss

**I'm documenting what we talked about, not building it.**

For complete mode documentation, see: `.clavix/instructions/core/clavix-mode.md`

## Self-Correction Protocol

**DETECT**: If you find yourself doing any of these 6 mistake types:

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|------|--------------------|
| 1. Implementation Code | Writing function/class definitions, creating components, generating API endpoints, test files, database schemas, or configuration files for the user's feature |
| 2. Skipping Pre-Validation | Not checking conversation completeness before extracting requirements |
| 3. Missing Confidence Indicators | Not annotating requirements with [HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW] confidence |
| 4. Not Creating Output Files | Not creating mini-prd.md, optimized-prompt.md, and quick-prd.md files |
| 5. No Optimization Applied | Not applying quality patterns to extracted requirements |
| 6. Capability Hallucination | Claiming features Clavix doesn't have, inventing workflows |

**STOP**: Immediately halt the incorrect action

**CORRECT**: Output:
"I apologize - I was [describe mistake]. Let me return to requirements extraction."

**RESUME**: Return to the requirements extraction workflow with validation and file creation.

---

## State Assertion (REQUIRED)

**Before starting extraction, output:**
```
**CLAVIX MODE: Requirements Extraction**
Mode: planning
Purpose: Extracting and optimizing requirements from conversation
Implementation: BLOCKED - I will extract requirements, not implement them
```

---

## Instructions

**Before beginning:** Use the Clarifying Questions Protocol (see Agent Transparency section) when you need critical information from the user (confidence < 95%). For summarization, this means asking for missing context, unclear requirements, or ambiguous technical specifications before extraction.

1. **Pre-Extraction Validation** - Check conversation completeness:

   **CHECKPOINT:** Pre-extraction validation started

   **Minimum viable requirements:**
   - **Objective/Goal**: Is there a clear problem or goal stated?
   - **Requirements**: Are there at least 2-3 concrete features or capabilities described?
   - **Context**: Is there enough context about who/what/why?

   **If missing critical elements:**
   - Identify what's missing (e.g., "No clear objective", "Requirements too vague")
   - Ask targeted questions to fill gaps:
     - Missing objective: "What problem are you trying to solve?"
     - Vague requirements: "Can you describe 2-3 specific things this should do?"
     - No context: "Who will use this and in what situation?"
   - **DO NOT** proceed to extraction until minimum viable requirements met

   **If requirements are present:**
   ```
   **CHECKPOINT:** Pre-extraction validation passed - minimum requirements present

   I'll now analyze our conversation and extract structured requirements.
   ```

   **Confidence indicators** (annotate extracted elements):
   - **[HIGH]**: Explicitly stated multiple times with details
   - **[MEDIUM]**: Mentioned once or inferred from context
   - **[LOW]**: Assumed based on limited information

2. **Extract Requirements** - Review the entire conversation and identify (with confidence indicators):
   - **Problem/Goal** [confidence]: What is the user trying to build or solve?
   - **Key Requirements** [confidence per requirement]: What features and functionality were discussed?
   - **Technical Constraints** [confidence]: Any technologies, integrations, or performance needs?
   - **Architecture & Design** [confidence]: Any specific patterns, structures, or design choices?
   - **User Needs** [confidence]: Who are the end users and what do they need?
   - **Success Criteria** [confidence]: How will success be measured?
   - **Context** [confidence]: Any important background or constraints?

   **Calculate Extraction Confidence:**
   - Start with 50% base (conversational content detected)
   - Add 20% if concrete requirements extracted
   - Add 15% if clear goals identified
   - Add 15% if constraints defined
   - Display: "*Extraction confidence: X%*"
   - If confidence < 80%, include verification prompt in output

   **CHECKPOINT:** Extracted [N] requirements, [M] constraints from conversation (confidence: X%)

3. **CREATE OUTPUT FILES (REQUIRED)** - You MUST create three files. This is not optional.

   **Step 3.1: Determine project name (Suggest + Confirm)**

   Before creating files, derive a project name from the conversation:

   1. **Analyze conversation** to extract a meaningful name:
      - Look for explicit project names mentioned
      - Identify the main topic/feature being discussed
      - Use key nouns (e.g., "auth", "dashboard", "todo")

   2. **Generate suggested name**:
      - Format: lowercase, hyphen-separated (e.g., "user-auth", "sales-dashboard")
      - Keep it short (2-4 words max)
      - Make it descriptive but concise

   3. **Ask user to confirm**:
      ```
      I'll save these requirements as project "[suggested-name]".

      Is this name okay? (y/n/custom name)
      ```

   4. **Handle response**:
      - "y" or "yes" → use suggested name
      - "n" or "no" → ask for custom name
      - Any other text → use that as the project name (sanitize to lowercase-hyphenated)

   **Step 3.2: Create directory structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/[project-name]
   ```

   **Note (Backwards Compatibility):** Legacy workflows may have used `.clavix/outputs/summarize/` as output. The `/clavix-plan` and `/clavix-implement` commands check both project directories and the legacy `summarize/` location.

   **Step 3.3: Write mini-prd.md**

   Use the Write tool to create `.clavix/outputs/[project-name]/mini-prd.md` with this content:

   **Mini-PRD template:**
   ```markdown
   # Requirements: [Project Name]

   *Generated from conversation on [date]*

   ## Objective
   [Clear, specific goal extracted from conversation]

   ## Core Requirements

   ### Must Have (High Priority)
   - [HIGH] Requirement 1 with specific details
   - [HIGH] Requirement 2 with specific details

   ### Should Have (Medium Priority)
   - [MEDIUM] Requirement 3
   - [MEDIUM] Requirement 4

   ### Could Have (Low Priority / Inferred)
   - [LOW] Requirement 5

   ## Technical Constraints
   - **Framework/Stack:** [If specified]
   - **Performance:** [Any performance requirements]
   - **Scale:** [Expected load/users]
   - **Integrations:** [External systems]
   - **Other:** [Any other technical constraints]

   ## Architecture & Design
   - **Pattern:** [e.g. Monolith, Microservices, Serverless]
   - **Structure:** [e.g. Feature-based, Layered, Clean Architecture]
   - **Key Decisions:** [Specific design choices made]

   ## User Context
   **Target Users:** [Who will use this?]
   **Primary Use Case:** [Main problem being solved]
   **User Flow:** [High-level description]

   ## Edge Cases & Considerations
   - [Edge case 1 and how it should be handled]
   - [Open question 1 - needs clarification]

   ## Implicit Requirements
   *Inferred from conversation context - please verify:*
   - [Category] [Requirement inferred from discussion]
   - [Category] [Another requirement]
   > **Note:** These requirements were surfaced by analyzing conversation patterns.

   ## Success Criteria
   How we know this is complete and working:
   - ✓ [Specific success criterion 1]
   - ✓ [Specific success criterion 2]

   ## Next Steps
   1. Review this PRD for accuracy and completeness
   2. If anything is missing or unclear, continue the conversation
   3. When ready, use the optimized prompt for implementation

   ---
   *This PRD was generated by Clavix from conversational requirements gathering.*
   ```

   **CHECKPOINT:** Created mini-prd.md successfully

   **Step 3.4: Write original-prompt.md**

   Use the Write tool to create `.clavix/outputs/[project-name]/original-prompt.md`

   **Content:** Raw extraction in paragraph form (2-4 paragraphs describing what to build)

   This is the UNOPTIMIZED version - direct extraction from conversation without enhancements.

   **Format:**
   ```markdown
   # Original Prompt (Extracted from Conversation)

   [Paragraph 1: Project objective and core functionality]

   [Paragraph 2: Key features and requirements]

   [Paragraph 3: Technical constraints and context]

   [Paragraph 4: Success criteria and additional considerations]

   ---
   *Extracted by Clavix on [date]. See optimized-prompt.md for enhanced version.*
   ```

   **CHECKPOINT:** Created original-prompt.md successfully

   **Step 3.5: Write optimized-prompt.md**

   Use the Write tool to create `.clavix/outputs/[project-name]/optimized-prompt.md`

   **Content:** Enhanced version with pattern-based optimization (see step 4 below for optimization)

   **Format:**
   ```markdown
   # Optimized Prompt (Clavix Enhanced)

   [Enhanced paragraph 1 with improvements applied]

   [Enhanced paragraph 2...]

   [Enhanced paragraph 3...]

   ---

   ## Optimization Improvements Applied

   1. **[ADDED]** - [Description of what was added and why]
   2. **[CLARIFIED]** - [What was ambiguous and how it was clarified]
   3. **[STRUCTURED]** - [How information was reorganized]
   4. **[EXPANDED]** - [What detail was added]
   5. **[SCOPED]** - [What boundaries were defined]

   ---
   *Optimized by Clavix on [date]. This version is ready for implementation.*
   ```

   **CHECKPOINT:** Created optimized-prompt.md successfully

   **Step 3.6: Verify file creation**

   List the created files to confirm they exist:
   ```
   Created files in .clavix/outputs/[project-name]/:
   ✓ mini-prd.md
   ✓ original-prompt.md
   ✓ optimized-prompt.md
   ```

   **CHECKPOINT:** All files created and verified successfully

   **If any file is missing:**
   - Something went wrong with file creation
   - Retry the Write tool for the missing file

4. **Pattern-Based Optimization** (automatic with labeled improvements):
   - After extracting the prompt, analyze using pattern-based optimization
   - Apply optimizations for Clarity, Efficiency, Structure, Completeness, and Actionability
   - **Label all improvements** with quality dimension tags:
     - **[Efficiency]**: "Removed 12 conversational words, reduced from 45 to 28 words"
     - **[Structure]**: "Reorganized flow: context → requirements → constraints → success criteria"
     - **[Clarity]**: "Added explicit output format (React component), persona (senior dev)"
     - **[Completeness]**: "Added missing success metrics (load time < 2s, user adoption rate)"
     - **[Actionability]**: "Converted vague goals into specific, measurable requirements"
   - Display both raw extraction and optimized version
   - Show quality scores (before/after) and labeled improvements
   - These improvements were already applied when creating optimized-prompt.md in step 3.4

   **CHECKPOINT:** Applied pattern-based optimization - [N] improvements added

5. **Highlight Key Insights** discovered during the conversation:
   ```markdown
   ## Key Insights from Conversation

   1. **[Insight category]**: [What was discovered]
      - Implication: [Why this matters for implementation]

   2. **[Insight category]**: [What was discovered]
      - Implication: [Why this matters]
   ```

6. **Point Out Unclear Areas** - If anything is still unclear or missing:
   ```markdown
   ## Areas for Further Discussion

   The following points could use clarification:

   1. **[Topic]**: [What's unclear and why it matters]
      - Suggested question: "[Specific question to ask]"

   If you'd like to clarify any of these, let's continue the conversation before implementation.
   ```

7. **Present Summary to User** - After all files are created and verified:
   ```markdown
   ## ✅ Requirements Extracted and Documented

   I've analyzed our conversation and created structured outputs:

   **📄 Files Created:**
   - **mini-prd.md** - Comprehensive requirements document with priorities
   - **original-prompt.md** - Raw extraction from our conversation
   - **optimized-prompt.md** - Enhanced version ready for implementation

   **📁 Location:** `.clavix/outputs/[project-name]/`

   **🎯 Optimizations Applied:**
   Applied [N] improvements:
   - [Brief summary of improvements]

   **🔍 Key Insights:**
   - [Top 2-3 insights in one line each]

   **⚠️ Unclear Areas:**
   [If any, list briefly, otherwise omit this section]

   ---

   **Next Steps:**
   1. Review the mini-PRD for accuracy
   2. If anything needs adjustment, let me know and we can refine
   3. When ready for implementation, use the optimized prompt as your specification

   Would you like me to clarify or expand on anything?
   ```

   **CHECKPOINT:** Summarization workflow complete - all outputs created

## Quality Enhancement

**What gets optimized (5 dimensions):**
- **Clarity**: Remove ambiguity from extracted requirements
- **Efficiency**: Remove verbosity and conversational fluff
- **Structure**: Ensure logical flow (context → requirements → constraints → output)
- **Completeness**: Add missing specifications, formats, success criteria
- **Actionability**: Make requirements specific and executable

**Why Specificity is excluded:**
The `/clavix-summarize` command extracts requirements from exploratory conversations. Users in discovery mode often haven't determined concrete specifics yet (exact versions, file paths, numeric thresholds). Penalizing for missing specifics would unfairly score valid exploratory outputs. If specific details are needed, use `/clavix-improve` on the extracted prompt or proceed to `/clavix-prd` for full specification.

**Output files:**
- `original-prompt.md` - Raw extraction from conversation
- `optimized-prompt.md` - Enhanced version (recommended for AI agents)
- `mini-prd.md` - Structured requirements document

## Quality Checks

- Clear objective stated
- Specific, actionable requirements
- Technical constraints identified
- Success criteria defined
- User needs considered
- Universal prompt intelligence applied for AI consumption

## Agent Transparency (v5.9.0)

### Agent Manual (Universal Protocols)
# Clavix Agent Manual (v5.1)

This is the consolidated agent protocol reference. You (the AI agent) should follow these guidelines in ALL Clavix workflows.

---

## Core Principle: Agentic-First Architecture

Clavix v5 follows an **agentic-first architecture**. This means:

1. **You execute workflows directly** using your native tools (Write, Read, Edit, Bash)
2. **Slash commands are templates** that you read and follow - not CLI commands
3. **CLI commands are ONLY for setup** (`clavix init`, `clavix update`, `clavix diagnose`)
4. **You save outputs to `.clavix/outputs/`** using your Write tool

**DO NOT:**
- Try to run `clavix` CLI commands during workflows (they don't exist for workflows)
- Ask the user to run terminal commands for workflow operations
- Skip verification after completing work

## REQUIRED: Output Verification Protocol

**After EVERY file operation, verify success:**

| Step | Action | How to Verify |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Write file | Use Write tool |
| 2 | Verify exists | Use Read tool to confirm file was created |
| 3 | Report to user | Show ACTUAL file path (not placeholder) |

**⚠️ Never tell the user a file was saved without verifying it exists.**

---

## Handling Problems Gracefully

When something goes wrong, fix it yourself when possible. When you can't, explain simply and offer options.

### Three Types of Problems

#### 1. Small Hiccups (Fix Yourself)

These are minor issues you can handle automatically. Fix them and move on.

| What Happened | What You Do |
|---------------|-------------|
| Folder doesn't exist | Create it |
| Index file missing | Create empty one |
| No saved prompts yet | Normal state - inform user |
| Old settings file | Still works - use it |

**Your approach:**
1. Fix the issue automatically
2. Maybe mention it briefly: "Setting things up..."
3. Continue with what you were doing

#### 2. Need User Input (Ask Nicely)

These need a decision from the user. Stop, explain simply, and offer clear choices.

| What Happened | What You Ask |
|---------------|--------------|
| Can't find that task | "I can't find task [X]. Let me show you what's available..." |
| Multiple projects found | "I found a few projects. Which one should we work on?" |
| Not sure what you want | "I want to make sure I understand - is this about [A] or [B]?" |
| File already exists | "This file already exists. Replace, rename, or cancel?" |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop what you're doing
2. Explain the situation simply
3. Give 2-3 clear options
4. Wait for their answer

#### 3. Real Problems (Need Their Help)

These are issues you can't fix. Stop completely and explain what they need to do.

| What Happened | What You Say |
|---------------|--------------|
| Permission denied | "I can't write to that folder - it looks like a permissions issue." |
| Config file broken | "Settings file got corrupted. You might need to delete it and start fresh." |
| Git conflict | "There's a git conflict that needs your attention." |
| Disk full | "Disk is full - I can't save anything." |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Explain what went wrong (simply!)
3. Tell them what needs to happen to fix it

### The Golden Rules

1. **Fix it yourself if you can** - Don't bother users with small stuff
2. **Explain simply when you can't** - No error codes, no jargon
3. **Always offer a path forward** - Never leave them stuck
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose what they've done
5. **Stay calm and friendly** - Problems happen, no big deal

---

## Agent Decision Rules

These rules define deterministic agent behavior. Follow exactly.

### Rule 1: Quality-Based Decisions

```
IF quality < 60%:
  → ACTION: Suggest comprehensive analysis
  → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Consider comprehensive depth."

IF quality >= 60% AND quality < 80%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with optimization
  → SHOW: Improvement suggestions

IF quality >= 80%:
  → ACTION: Ready to use
  → SAY: "Quality is good ([X]%). Ready to proceed."
```

### Rule 2: Intent Confidence

```
IF confidence >= 85%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with detected intent

IF confidence 70-84%:
  → ACTION: Proceed, note secondary intent if >25%

IF confidence 50-69%:
  → ACTION: Ask user to confirm

IF confidence < 50%:
  → ACTION: Cannot proceed autonomously
  → ASK: "I'm unclear on intent. Is this: [A] | [B] | [C]?"
```

### Rule 3: File Operations

```
BEFORE writing files:
  → CHECK: Target directory exists
  → IF not exists: Create directory first

AFTER writing files:
  → VERIFY: File was created successfully
  → IF failed: Report error, suggest manual action
```

### Rule 4: Task Completion (Implementation Mode)

```
AFTER implementing task:
  → EDIT tasks.md: Change - [ ] to - [x] for completed task

IF edit succeeds:
  → SHOW: Next task automatically
  → CONTINUE with next task

IF edit fails:
  → SHOW error to user
  → ASK: "Task completion failed. How to proceed?"
```

### Rule 5: Error Recovery

```
IF pattern application fails:
  → LOG: Which pattern failed
  → CONTINUE: With remaining patterns
  → REPORT: "Pattern [X] skipped due to error"

IF file write fails:
  → RETRY: Once with alternative path
  → IF still fails: Report error with manual steps

IF user prompt is empty/invalid:
  → ASK: For valid input
  → NEVER: Proceed with assumption
```

### Rule 6: Execution Verification

```
BEFORE completing response:
  → VERIFY all checkpoints met for current mode
  → IF any checkpoint failed:
    → REPORT which checkpoint failed
    → EXPLAIN why it failed
    → SUGGEST recovery action
```

---

## What You Should NEVER Do

❌ **Don't silently skip tasks** - Always tell user if something was skipped
❌ **Don't make assumptions** - When in doubt, ask
❌ **Don't give up too easily** - Try to recover first
❌ **Don't overwhelm with options** - Max 3 choices
❌ **Don't use technical language** - Keep it friendly
❌ **Don't blame the user** - Even if they caused the issue
❌ **Don't claim features don't exist** - Check before saying no
❌ **Don't output "saved" without verification** - That's lying to the user

---

## Mode Boundaries

Each Clavix command has a specific mode. Stay within your mode:

| Mode | What You DO | What You DON'T DO |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Improve** | Analyze and optimize prompts | Implement the feature described |
| **PRD** | Guide strategic questions, create PRD | Write implementation code |
| **Plan** | Generate task breakdown | Start implementing tasks |
| **Implement** | Build tasks/prompts | Skip to next task without marking complete |
| **Start** | Gather requirements conversationally | Start implementing |
| **Summarize** | Extract requirements from conversation | Implement the requirements |
| **Verify** | Check implementation, run tests | Fix issues (only report them) |
| **Archive** | Move completed projects | Delete without confirmation |

**If you catch yourself crossing mode boundaries:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Say: "I apologize - I was [mistake]. Let me return to [correct mode]."
3. Resume correct workflow

---

## Communication Style

**Don't say this:**
> "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.clavix/outputs/prompts/'"

**Say this:**
> "Setting up your prompt storage..." (then just create the directory)

**Don't say this:**
> "Error: EACCES: permission denied"

**Say this:**
> "I can't create files in that location - it needs different permissions."

**Don't say this:**
> "SyntaxError: Unexpected token } in JSON"

**Say this:**
> "The settings file got corrupted. I can start fresh if you want."

---

## Clarifying Questions Protocol

# Clarifying Questions Protocol

When the user's request requires critical information to proceed correctly, use this protocol to gather necessary details systematically.

## When to Ask Clarifying Questions

Ask clarifying questions when:
- **Critical ambiguity exists** - The request has multiple valid interpretations that lead to substantially different outcomes
- **Missing essential context** - Information necessary to complete the task successfully is absent
- **Technical specifications needed** - Specific versions, paths, identifiers, or constraints are required
- **User choice required** - Multiple valid approaches exist and the user's preference is needed

**Do NOT ask clarifying questions when:**
- The information is trivial or easily inferred from context
- You can make a reasonable default assumption and mention it
- The question would slow down obviously simple tasks
- You're seeking perfection rather than addressing genuine ambiguity

## Question Format

Use this structured format for maximum clarity and efficiency:

### a. Multiple Choice Questions

When presenting options, use clear labels and make selection easy:

**Question:** [Your question here]

**Options:**
- **a.** First option - brief explanation
- **b.** Second option - brief explanation  
- **c.** Third option - brief explanation

**Please respond with your choice (e.g., 'a' or 'option a').**

### b. Custom Input Questions

When you need specific information not in a predefined list:

**Question:** [Your question here]

**Please provide:** [Clear description of what format/content you need]

**Example:** [Show an example of valid input]

## Confidence Threshold

**Ask clarifying questions when confidence < 95%**

If you're 95%+ confident you understand the user's intent and have the necessary information, proceed without asking. If confidence is below 95%, stop and ask.

## Best Practices

1. **Ask questions sequentially** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions at once unless they're tightly related
2. **Explain why you're asking** - Briefly state what the answer will help you determine
3. **Limit options** - Present 2-4 options maximum for choice questions
4. **Make defaults clear** - If there's a sensible default, state it and ask for confirmation
5. **Batch related questions** - If multiple questions are interdependent, present them together

## Examples

### Good: Clear Multiple Choice
> I need to know where to save the configuration file to proceed correctly.
>
> **Options:**
> - **a.** Project root (recommended for project-specific configs)
> - **b.** Home directory (for user-wide settings)
> - **c.** Custom path (you specify)
>
> **Please respond with your choice (e.g., 'a').**

### Good: Custom Input with Context
> To generate the migration script, I need the database schema version.
>
> **Please provide:** The current schema version number (e.g., "2.1.0" or "v3.4")
>
> If you're unsure, you can check with: `npm run db:version`

### Bad: Unnecessary Question
> ❌ "Do you want me to use good coding practices?"
>
> (This is always implied - just do it)

### Bad: Analysis Paralysis
> ❌ "Should I use const or let for this variable?"
>
> (This is implementation detail - decide yourself based on best practices)

## Recovery Pattern

If you realize you should have asked clarifying questions AFTER starting:

1. **STOP** the current approach
2. **EXPLAIN** what you discovered that requires clarification  
3. **ASK** the necessary questions
4. **RESUME** with the correct approach once answered

**Example:**
> I apologize - I started implementing the auth flow but realized I need to clarify which authentication method you want to use. Are we implementing: (a) JWT tokens, (b) Session-based auth, or (c) OAuth2?

## Verification Block Template

At the end of workflows that produce output, include verification:

```
## Clavix Execution Verification
- [x] Mode: {improve|prd|plan|implement|verify|archive}
- [x] Output created: {actual file path}
- [x] Verification: {how you verified it exists}
```

### How to Explain Improvements
## Explaining Improvements to Users

When you improve a prompt, explain WHAT changed and WHY it helps. No technical jargon.

---

### How to Present Improvements

**Instead of:**
> "Applied patterns: ConcisenessFilter, AmbiguityDetector, ActionabilityEnhancer"

**Say:**
> "Here's what I improved:
>
> 1. **Trimmed the fluff** - Removed words that weren't adding value
> 2. **Made it clearer** - Changed vague terms to specific ones
> 3. **Added next steps** - So the AI knows exactly what to do"

---

### Pattern Explanations (Plain English)

#### When You Remove Unnecessary Words
**Pattern:** ConcisenessFilter
**Say:** "I trimmed some unnecessary words to make your prompt cleaner and faster for the AI to process."
**Show before/after:** "Build me a really good and nice todo application" → "Build a todo application"

#### When You Clarify Vague Terms
**Pattern:** AmbiguityDetector
**Say:** "I noticed some vague terms that could confuse the AI - I made them more specific."
**Show before/after:** "make it better" → "improve the loading speed and add error messages"

#### When You Add Missing Details
**Pattern:** CompletenessValidator
**Say:** "Your prompt was missing some key details the AI needs. I added them."
**Show before/after:** "build an API" → "build a REST API using Node.js with Express, returning JSON responses"

#### When You Make It Actionable
**Pattern:** ActionabilityEnhancer
**Say:** "I added concrete next steps so the AI can start working immediately."
**Show before/after:** "help with authentication" → "implement JWT authentication with login, logout, and token refresh endpoints"

#### When You Reorganize Structure
**Pattern:** StructureOrganizer
**Say:** "I reorganized your prompt so it flows more logically - easier for the AI to follow."
**Example:** Grouped related requirements together, put context before requests

#### When You Add Success Criteria
**Pattern:** SuccessCriteriaEnforcer
**Say:** "I added success criteria so you'll know when the AI got it right."
**Show before/after:** "make a search feature" → "make a search feature that returns results in under 200ms and highlights matching terms"

#### When You Add Technical Context
**Pattern:** TechnicalContextEnricher
**Say:** "I added technical details that help the AI understand your environment."
**Example:** Added framework version, database type, deployment target

#### When You Identify Edge Cases
**Pattern:** EdgeCaseIdentifier
**Say:** "I spotted some edge cases you might not have thought about - added them to be thorough."
**Example:** "What happens if the user isn't logged in? What if the list is empty?"

#### When You Add Alternatives
**Pattern:** AlternativePhrasingGenerator
**Say:** "I created a few different ways to phrase this - pick the one that feels right."
**Example:** Shows 2-3 variations with different emphasis

#### When You Create a Checklist
**Pattern:** ValidationChecklistCreator
**Say:** "I created a checklist to verify everything works when you're done."
**Example:** Shows validation items to check after implementation

#### When You Make Assumptions Explicit
**Pattern:** AssumptionExplicitizer
**Say:** "I spelled out some assumptions that were implied - prevents misunderstandings."
**Show before/after:** "add user profiles" → "add user profiles (assuming users are already authenticated and stored in PostgreSQL)"

#### When You Define Scope
**Pattern:** ScopeDefiner
**Say:** "I clarified what's included and what's not - keeps the AI focused."
**Example:** "This feature includes X and Y, but NOT Z (that's for later)"

### Showing Quality Improvements

**Before showing scores, explain them:**

> "Let me show you how your prompt improved:
>
> | What I Checked | Before | After | What This Means |
> |----------------|--------|-------|-----------------|
> | Clarity | 5/10 | 8/10 | Much easier to understand now |
> | Completeness | 4/10 | 9/10 | Has all the details AI needs |
> | Actionability | 3/10 | 8/10 | AI can start working right away |
>
> **Overall: Your prompt went from OK to Great!**"

---

### When to Show Detailed vs Brief Explanations

**Brief (for simple improvements):**
> "I cleaned up your prompt - removed some fluff and made it clearer.
> Ready to use!"

**Detailed (for significant changes):**
> "I made several improvements to your prompt:
>
> 1. **Clarity** - Changed 'make it work good' to specific requirements
> 2. **Missing pieces** - Added database type, API format, error handling
> 3. **Success criteria** - Added how to know when it's done
>
> Here's the improved version: [show prompt]"

---

### Handling "Why Did You Change That?"

If user questions a change:

> "Good question! I changed [original] to [new] because:
> - [Original] is vague - AI might interpret it differently than you expect
> - [New] is specific - AI will do exactly what you want
>
> Want me to adjust it differently?"

---

### Quality Dimensions (Plain English)
## Quality Dimensions Reference

When you check a prompt's quality, you're looking at 6 things. Here's what each one means and how to explain it to users.

---

### The 6 Quality Dimensions (Plain English)

#### 1. Clarity - "How clear is your prompt?"

**What you're checking:** Can AI understand exactly what the user wants?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "Crystal clear - AI will understand immediately" |
| 5-7 | "Mostly clear, but some terms might confuse the AI" |
| 1-4 | "Pretty vague - AI might misunderstand you" |

**Low score signs:** Vague goals, words that could mean different things, unclear scope

**Example feedback:**
> "Your prompt says 'make it better' - better how? Faster? Prettier? More features?
> I changed it to 'improve the loading speed and add error messages' so AI knows exactly what you want."

---

#### 2. Efficiency - "How concise is your prompt?"

**What you're checking:** Does every word earn its place?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "No wasted words - everything counts" |
| 5-7 | "Some filler that could be trimmed" |
| 1-4 | "Lots of repetition or unnecessary detail" |

**Low score signs:** Filler words, pleasantries ("please kindly..."), saying the same thing twice

**Example feedback:**
> "I trimmed some unnecessary words. 'Please kindly help me with building...'
> became 'Build...' - same meaning, faster for AI to process."

---

#### 3. Structure - "How organized is your prompt?"

**What you're checking:** Does information flow logically?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "Well organized - easy to follow" |
| 5-7 | "Decent organization, could be clearer" |
| 1-4 | "Jumbled - hard to follow what you're asking" |

**Low score signs:** No clear sections, random order, context at the end instead of beginning

**Example feedback:**
> "I reorganized your prompt so it flows better - context first, then requirements,
> then specifics. Easier for AI to follow."

---

#### 4. Completeness - "Does it have everything AI needs?"

**What you're checking:** Are all critical details provided?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "All the important details are there" |
| 5-7 | "Most info is there, but some gaps" |
| 1-4 | "Missing key details AI needs to help you" |

**Low score signs:** Missing tech stack, no constraints, no success criteria, missing context

**Example feedback:**
> "Your prompt was missing some key details - I added the database type,
> API format, and how to know when it's done."

---

#### 5. Actionability - "Can AI start working right away?"

**What you're checking:** Is there enough to take immediate action?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "AI can start working immediately" |
| 5-7 | "General direction, but might need to ask questions" |
| 1-4 | "Too abstract - AI wouldn't know where to start" |

**Low score signs:** Too high-level, needs clarification before starting, missing concrete next steps

**Example feedback:**
> "Your prompt was pretty abstract. I added concrete next steps so AI
> knows exactly what to build first."

---

#### 6. Specificity - "How concrete are your requirements?"

**What you're checking:** Are there real details vs vague descriptions?

**How to explain scores:**
| Score | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 8-10 | "Specific details - versions, names, numbers" |
| 5-7 | "Some specifics, some vague" |
| 1-4 | "Too abstract - needs concrete details" |

**Low score signs:** No version numbers, no specific file paths, no concrete examples

**Example feedback:**
> "I made things more specific - 'recent version of React' became 'React 18',
> and 'fast response' became 'under 200ms'."

---

### Overall Quality (How to Present)

**Don't show this:**
> "Quality: 73% (Clarity: 7, Efficiency: 8, Structure: 6...)"

**Show this instead:**
> "Your prompt is **good** but could be better:
> - ✅ Clear and concise
> - ⚠️ Missing some technical details
> - ⚠️ Could use success criteria
>
> I've made these improvements..."

---

### When to Recommend Deep Analysis

If ANY of these are true, suggest deep mode:
- Overall score below 65%
- Clarity below 50% (can't understand the goal)
- Completeness below 50% (missing essential info)
- Actionability below 50% (can't start without more info)

**What to say:**
> "This prompt needs more work than a quick cleanup.
> Want me to do a thorough analysis? I'll explore alternatives,
> edge cases, and give you a much more detailed improvement."

---

### Quick Reference (For Internal Use)

| Dimension | Weight | Critical? |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Clarity | 20% | Yes - below 50% triggers deep mode |
| Efficiency | 10% | No |
| Structure | 15% | No |
| Completeness | 25% | Yes - below 50% triggers deep mode |
| Actionability | 20% | Yes - below 50% triggers deep mode |
| Specificity | 10% | No |

---

### Workflow-Specific Dimension Usage

Different Clavix workflows use quality dimensions in different ways:

| Workflow | Dimensions Used | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| `/clavix-improve` | All 6 | Full quality assessment for prompt optimization |
| `/clavix-prd` | All 6 | PRD quality requires all dimensions |
| `/clavix-summarize` | 5 (excludes Specificity) | Conversational extraction may lack concrete specifics by nature |
| `/clavix-refine` | All 6 | Refinement targets all quality aspects |

**Why Summarize Excludes Specificity:**
The `/clavix-summarize` command extracts requirements from conversation. Users in exploratory mode often haven't determined specific versions, numbers, or file paths yet. Penalizing for missing specifics would unfairly score valid exploratory outputs.

**Rationale for Dimension Selection:**
- **Clarity, Completeness, Actionability**: Always critical - these determine if AI can act on the prompt
- **Structure, Efficiency**: Important for complex prompts, less critical for simple ones
- **Specificity**: Important for implementation, less important for early-stage exploration


### Workflow State Detection
## Workflow State Detection

### PRD-to-Implementation States

```
NO_PROJECT → PRD_EXISTS → TASKS_EXIST → IMPLEMENTING → ALL_COMPLETE → ARCHIVED
```

### State Detection Protocol

**Step 1: Check for project config**
```
Read: .clavix/outputs/{project}/.clavix-implement-config.json
```

**Step 2: Interpret state based on conditions**

| Condition | State | Next Action |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Config missing, no PRD files | `NO_PROJECT` | Run /clavix-prd |
| PRD exists, no tasks.md | `PRD_EXISTS` | Run /clavix-plan |
| tasks.md exists, no config | `TASKS_EXIST` | Run /clavix-implement |
| config.stats.remaining > 0 | `IMPLEMENTING` | Continue from currentTask |
| config.stats.remaining == 0 | `ALL_COMPLETE` | Suggest /clavix-archive |
| Project in archive/ directory | `ARCHIVED` | Move back from archive to restore |

**Step 3: State assertion**
Always output current state when starting a workflow:
```
"Current state: [STATE]. Progress: [X]/[Y] tasks. Next: [action]"
```

### File Detection Guide

**PRD Files (check in order):**
1. `.clavix/outputs/{project}/full-prd.md` - Full PRD
2. `.clavix/outputs/{project}/quick-prd.md` - Quick PRD
3. `.clavix/outputs/{project}/mini-prd.md` - Mini PRD from summarize
4. `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*/optimized-prompt.md` - Saved prompts

**Task Files:**
- `.clavix/outputs/{project}/tasks.md` - Task breakdown

**Config Files:**
- `.clavix/outputs/{project}/.clavix-implement-config.json` - Implementation state

### State Transition Rules

```
NO_PROJECT:
  → /clavix-prd creates PRD_EXISTS
  → /clavix-start + /clavix-summarize creates PRD_EXISTS
  → /clavix-improve creates prompt (not PRD_EXISTS)

PRD_EXISTS:
  → /clavix-plan creates TASKS_EXIST

TASKS_EXIST:
  → /clavix-implement starts tasks → IMPLEMENTING

IMPLEMENTING:
  → Agent edits tasks.md (- [ ] → - [x]) reduces remaining
  → When remaining == 0 → ALL_COMPLETE

ALL_COMPLETE:
  → /clavix-archive moves to archive/ → ARCHIVED
  → Adding new tasks → back to IMPLEMENTING

ARCHIVED:
  → Agent moves project back from archive/ → back to previous state
```

### Prompt Lifecycle States (Separate from PRD)

```
NO_PROMPTS → PROMPT_EXISTS → EXECUTED → CLEANED
```

| Condition | State | Detection |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| No files in prompts/ | `NO_PROMPTS` | .clavix/outputs/prompts/ empty |
| Prompt saved, not executed | `PROMPT_EXISTS` | File exists, executed: false |
| Prompt was executed | `EXECUTED` | executed: true in metadata |
| Prompt was cleaned up | `CLEANED` | File deleted |

### Multi-Project Handling

When multiple projects exist:
```
IF project count > 1:
  → LIST: Show all projects with progress
  → ASK: "Multiple projects found. Which one?"
  → Options: [project names with % complete]
```

Project listing format:
```
Available projects:
  1. auth-feature (75% - 12/16 tasks)
  2. api-refactor (0% - not started)
  3. dashboard-v2 (100% - complete, suggest archive)
```


### CLI Reference
## CLI Commands Reference (v5.0 - Agentic-First)

Clavix v5 follows an **agentic-first architecture**. Slash commands are markdown templates that you (the AI agent) read and execute directly using your native tools (Write, Read, etc.).

**CLI commands are ONLY for project setup**, not for workflow execution.

---

### Setup Commands (User runs these)

These are commands the **user** runs in their terminal to set up Clavix:

#### `clavix init`
**What it does:** Sets up Clavix in current project
**When user runs it:** First time using Clavix in a project
**Features:**
- Auto-detects AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Configures integrations
- Creates .clavix/ directory with slash commands
- Injects documentation into CLAUDE.md

#### `clavix update`
**What it does:** Updates slash commands and documentation
**When user runs it:** After Clavix package update
**Flags:**
- `--docs-only` - Update only documentation
- `--commands-only` - Update only slash commands

#### `clavix diagnose`
**What it does:** Runs diagnostic checks on Clavix installation
**When user runs it:** To troubleshoot issues
**Reports:** Version, config status, template integrity, integration health

#### `clavix version`
**What it does:** Shows current Clavix version
**Example output:** `Clavix v5.0.0`

---

### How Workflows Execute (Agentic-First)

**In v5, you (the agent) execute workflows directly using your native tools:**

| Workflow | How You Execute It |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Save prompt** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<id>.md` (with frontmatter metadata) |
| **Save PRD** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/<project>/full-prd.md` |
| **Save tasks** | Use **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/<project>/tasks.md` |
| **Mark task complete** | Use **Edit tool** to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in tasks.md |
| **Archive project** | Use **Bash tool** to `mv .clavix/outputs/<project> .clavix/outputs/archive/` |
| **List prompts** | Use **Glob/Bash** to list `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` files |
| **Read project** | Use **Read tool** on `.clavix/outputs/<project>/` files |

---

### Agent Execution Protocol (v5)

**DO:**
1. Use your native tools (Write, Read, Edit, Bash) to perform operations
2. Save outputs to `.clavix/outputs/` directory structure
3. Follow the workflow instructions in each slash command template
4. Report results in friendly language to the user

**DON'T:**
1. Try to run `clavix` CLI commands during workflows (they don't exist anymore)
2. Ask user to run terminal commands for workflow operations
3. Skip verification after completing work
4. Assume CLI commands exist - use your tools directly

---

# Improved Prompt

[optimized prompt content]
```

---

### Removed Commands (v4 Legacy)

**IMPORTANT:** These commands were removed in v5. Do NOT try to run them:

| Removed Command | How Agents Handle This Now |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| `clavix fast/deep` | Use `/clavix-improve` - saves to `.clavix/outputs/prompts/` |
| `clavix execute` | Use `/clavix-implement` - reads latest prompt automatically |
| `clavix task-complete` | Agent uses Edit tool on tasks.md directly |
| `clavix prompts list` | Agent uses Glob/Bash to list `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md` |
| `clavix config` | User can run `clavix init` to reconfigure |

**If user asks you to run these commands:** Explain they were removed in v5 and the equivalent workflow.


### Recovery Patterns
## Recovery Patterns for Vibecoders

When something goes wrong, help users gracefully. Always try to fix it yourself first.

---

### Prompt Save Issues

#### Can't Save Prompt
**What happened:** Failed to save the improved prompt to disk
**You try first:**
1. Create the missing directory: `mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts/fast`
2. Retry the save operation

**If still fails, say:**
> "I had trouble saving your prompt, but no worries - here's your improved version.
> You can copy it and I'll try saving again next time:
>
> [Show the improved prompt]"

#### Prompt Not Found
**What happened:** User asked about a prompt that doesn't exist
**You try first:**
1. List files in `.clavix/outputs/prompts/` directory to see what's available
2. Check if there's a similar prompt ID

**Say:**
> "I can't find that prompt. Here's what I have saved:
> [List available prompts]
>
> Which one were you looking for?"

---

### Task Issues

#### Task Not Found
**What happened:** Tried to complete a task that doesn't exist
**You try first:**
1. Read `tasks.md` file to get current tasks
2. Check for typos in task ID

**Say:**
> "I can't find that task. Let me show you the available tasks:
> [List tasks]
>
> Which one did you mean?"

#### Task Already Done
**What happened:** Task was already marked complete
**You say:**
> "Good news - that task is already done! Here's what's left:
> [Show remaining tasks]"

#### Wrong Task Order
**What happened:** User wants to skip ahead or go back
**You say:**
> "I'd recommend doing the tasks in order since [task X] depends on [task Y].
> Want me to:
> 1. Continue with the current task
> 2. Skip ahead anyway (might cause issues)"

---

### Project Issues

#### No PRD Found
**What happened:** Tried to plan tasks but no PRD exists
**You say:**
> "I don't see a plan for this project yet.
> Want me to help you create one? Just describe what you're building
> and I'll put together a proper plan."

#### Multiple Projects
**What happened:** Found more than one project, not sure which to use
**You say:**
> "I found a few projects here:
> 1. **todo-app** - 3 tasks done, 2 remaining
> 2. **auth-feature** - Not started yet
>
> Which one should we work on?"

#### Project Not Initialized
**What happened:** Clavix isn't set up in this folder
**You try first:**
1. Run `clavix init` to set up automatically

**Say:**
> "Let me set up Clavix for this project real quick...
> [After init completes]
> All set! Now, what would you like to do?"

---

### Verification Issues

#### Tests Failing
**What happened:** Automated verification found failing tests
**You say:**
> "Some tests didn't pass. Here's what I found:
>
> ❌ **[Test name]** - [Brief explanation]
>
> Would you like me to:
> 1. Try to fix these issues
> 2. Show you more details about what failed
> 3. Skip verification for now (not recommended)"

#### Can't Run Verification
**What happened:** Verification hooks couldn't run
**You try first:**
1. Check if package.json exists
2. Check for npm/yarn/pnpm lock files

**Say:**
> "I couldn't run the automatic checks. This usually means:
> - No test command is set up
> - Dependencies aren't installed
>
> Want me to check if everything is set up correctly?"

#### Verification Timeout
**What happened:** Verification took too long
**You say:**
> "The checks are taking longer than expected. This might be a big test suite.
> Want me to:
> 1. Keep waiting
> 2. Cancel and mark for manual verification"

---

### File System Issues

#### Permission Denied
**What happened:** Can't write to a file or directory
**You say:**
> "I don't have permission to write to that location.
> This is usually a folder permissions issue.
>
> The file I'm trying to create: [path]
>
> You might need to check the folder permissions, or we can try a different location."

#### Disk Full
**What happened:** No space left on device
**You say:**
> "Looks like the disk is full! I can't save anything right now.
>
> Once you free up some space, we can continue where we left off."

#### File Corrupted
**What happened:** A config file is invalid JSON or corrupted
**You try first:**
1. Check if it's a simple syntax error
2. Try to recover valid data

**If can't recover, say:**
> "One of the config files got corrupted. I can:
> 1. Start fresh (you'll lose saved settings)
> 2. Show you the file so you can try to fix it manually
>
> What would you prefer?"

---

### Git Issues

#### Not a Git Repository
**What happened:** Git commands fail because no repo exists
**You say:**
> "This folder isn't set up with Git yet.
> Want me to initialize it? This will let me track your changes."

#### Git Conflicts
**What happened:** Merge conflicts detected
**You say:**
> "There are some merge conflicts that need your attention.
> I can't automatically resolve these because they need human judgment.
>
> Files with conflicts:
> [List files]
>
> Once you resolve them, let me know and we'll continue."

#### Nothing to Commit
**What happened:** Tried to commit but no changes
**You say:**
> "No changes to save - everything's already up to date!"

---

### Network Issues

#### Timeout
**What happened:** Network request timed out
**You try first:**
1. Retry the request once

**If still fails, say:**
> "Having trouble connecting. This might be a temporary network issue.
> Want me to try again, or should we continue without this?"

---

### General Recovery Protocol

For ANY unexpected error:

1. **Don't panic the user** - Stay calm, be helpful
2. **Explain simply** - No technical jargon
3. **Offer options** - Give 2-3 clear choices
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose user's content
5. **Provide a path forward** - Always suggest next steps

**Template:**
> "Hmm, something unexpected happened. [Brief, friendly explanation]
>
> Don't worry - your work is safe. Here's what we can do:
> 1. [Option A - usually try again]
> 2. [Option B - alternative approach]
> 3. [Option C - skip for now]
>
> What sounds good?"

## Workflow Navigation

**You are here:** Summarize (Conversation Extraction)

**State markers for workflow continuity:**
- If user came from `/clavix-start`: There's conversation context to extract
- If user invoked directly: Look for any recent conversation in context
- If conversation was technical: Focus on implementation details in extraction
- If conversation was exploratory: Focus on requirements and goals

**Common workflows:**
- **Standard flow**: `/clavix-start` → [conversation] → `/clavix-summarize` → Use optimized prompt
- **To implementation**: `/clavix-summarize` → `/clavix-plan` → `/clavix-implement` → `/clavix-archive`
- **Standalone use**: [Any conversation] → `/clavix-summarize` → Extract and optimize

**After completion, guide user to:**
- `/clavix-plan` - Generate tasks from the mini-PRD (if strategic)
- `/clavix-implement --latest` - Build directly (if simple)
- `/clavix-improve` - Polish the extracted prompt further

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix-start` - Begin conversational exploration (typical previous step)
- `/clavix-plan` - Generate tasks from extracted mini-PRD (next step)
- `/clavix-improve` - Further optimize the extracted prompt

## Example

From conversation about "analytics dashboard for sales team"...

**Original Extraction**:
```
We discussed building a dashboard for the sales team that shows analytics. They want to see revenue trends and who's performing well. It should update in real-time and help managers spot problems. We talked about using React and connecting to Salesforce.
```

**Optimized Prompt**:
```
Build a real-time sales analytics dashboard for the sales team showing revenue trends, top performers, pipeline status, and conversion rates. The dashboard should update live as deals progress, support filtering by date range/region/rep, and display key metrics prominently. Users need to quickly identify at-risk deals and celebrate wins.

Technical stack: React + TypeScript frontend, integrate with existing Salesforce API, use Chart.js for visualizations, responsive design for mobile access. Must handle 10K+ deals without performance degradation.

Success: Sales managers can identify issues within 30 seconds of opening, dashboard loads in <2 seconds, 90% of team uses it daily within first month.
```

**Improvements Applied**:
- **[Efficiency]**: Removed 8 conversational phrases, increased information density
- **[Structure]**: Organized into objective → requirements → technical → success
- **[Clarity]**: Specified exact features (filtering, metrics display) instead of vague "shows analytics"
- **[Completeness]**: Added performance requirements (10K+ deals, <2s load), success metrics (30s to identify issues, 90% adoption)
- **[Actionability]**: Converted "help managers spot problems" into specific, measurable outcome

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Files not created or verification fails
**Cause**: Skipped file creation steps or Write tool not used
**Solution**:
- Review step 3 file creation instructions
- Ensure each file has explicit Write tool step
- Verify all files exist before continuing
- Retry the Write tool for any missing files

### Issue: Pre-extraction validation fails (missing objective/requirements)
**Cause**: Conversation didn't cover enough detail
**Solution** (inline - DO NOT extract):
- List what's missing specifically
- Ask targeted questions to fill gaps
- Only proceed to extraction after minimum viable requirements met
- Show confidence indicators for what WAS discussed

### Issue: Conversation covered multiple unrelated topics
**Cause**: Exploratory discussion without focus
**Solution**:
- Ask user which topic to extract/focus on
- Or extract all topics separately into different sections
- Mark multi-topic extraction with [MULTI-TOPIC] indicator
- Suggest breaking into separate PRDs for each topic

### Issue: Optimization doesn't significantly improve extracted prompt
**Cause**: Conversation was already well-structured and detailed
**Solution**:
- Minor improvements are normal for good conversations
- Show quality scores (should be high: >80%)
- Still provide both versions but note that original extraction was already high quality

### Issue: Low confidence indicators across all extracted elements
**Cause**: Conversation was too vague or high-level
**Solution** (inline):
- Don't just extract with [LOW] markers everywhere
- Ask follow-up questions to increase confidence
- Or inform user: "Our conversation was exploratory. I recommend `/clavix-start` to go deeper, or `/clavix-prd` for structured planning"

### Issue: Extracted prompt contradicts earlier conversation
**Cause**: Requirements evolved during conversation
**Solution**:
- Use latest/final version of requirements
- Note that requirements evolved
- Ask user to confirm which version is correct
- Suggest starting fresh with `/clavix-prd` if major contradictions exist
